        <p>Every scientific leap forces the same question: <em>just because we can, should we?</em></p>

        <p>When medicine learns how to rebuild neurons and re-ignite memory pathways, we’re no longer talking about recovery—we’re talking about <strong>extension</strong>.  Extending life.  Extending ability.  Maybe even extending identity.</p>

        <h3>⚖️ The Unequal Frontier</h3>
        <p>History tells us who benefits first from new tech: those who can pay for it.  The same country that can’t guarantee insulin will gladly sell neural repair therapy for six figures.  If a child in Bronzeville and a billionaire in Beverly Hills both start to lose their memories, who do you think gets a slot in the trial?</p>

        <p>We already see it with AI.  Wealthy patients get predictive diagnostics while community clinics fight to keep the lights on.  The digital divide is turning into a biological one.</p>

        <h3>🧩 What Makes Us Human?</h3>
        <p>If science can patch memories, upgrade processing speed, or mute trauma, then what’s left of the original “you”?  The brain is more than an organ—it’s a fingerprint made of experience.  If we start swapping parts, where’s the line between a cure and a rewrite?</p>

        <p>There’s a strange irony here: we chase immortality through code, but we risk deleting the very imperfections that make us human.</p>

        <h3>🚦Where Ethics Meets Innovation</h3>
        <p>Developers like me build automation every day, but even in code there’s a rule: <em>one wrong loop can crash the whole system.</em>  Medicine’s no different.  If we don’t define ethical limits before quantum-powered biotech arrives, we might end up “fixing” people until nobody remembers what real humanity looks like.</p>
