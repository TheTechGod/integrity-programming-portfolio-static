        <p>For me, building Coffee + Kids + Code was never just about creating a blog. It was about creating a voice.</p>

        <p>I’ve spent the last few years rebuilding my life—piece by piece—after losing Shanda. Grieving while raising my kids and trying to get my career back on track hasn’t been a straight path. There’s no manual for single fatherhood, no debugger for loss. But there is code—and code, in its strange way, helped me find rhythm again.</p>

        <p>Every developer knows that feeling when you finally fix a stubborn bug—the quiet satisfaction, the control returning to your hands. After everything fell apart, I needed that feeling back. I needed something I could shape, repair, and see come to life again. This blog became that outlet. It’s proof of skill, yes—but more than that, it’s proof of perseverance.</p>

        <h3>Building something that reflects life</h3>
        <p>Each line of code in this project carries a piece of my story. The structure, the design, even the name—it all represents balance. Coffee, for the long nights. Kids, for the chaos that keeps me grounded. Code, for the craft that keeps me moving forward.</p>

        <p>As I planned this site, I wasn’t just building a portfolio or trying to prove my technical ability. I was creating a digital reflection of who I’ve become—a man trying to rebuild, to teach, to provide, and to process. This project is a conversation between logic and emotion, between fatherhood and engineering. It’s the bridge between who I was and who I’m becoming.</p>

        <h3>The mission behind the build</h3>
        <p>I want this series to be more than a dev tutorial. It’s a roadmap for anyone starting over. Each phase of this project—planning, design, front-end, back-end, and deployment—represents a step in rebuilding yourself after loss. There’s technical progress and emotional progress, both happening side by side.</p>

        <p>For now, this post marks the foundation: the concept. The idea that we can build our way out of chaos. That code can be both career and therapy. That even when life throws errors, you can refactor your way forward.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>In the next post, I’ll shift from concept to construction—laying out the front-end foundation and sharing how I approached the design from a place of both practicality and purpose. But this first one will always matter most. Because before the code came the reason.</p>
